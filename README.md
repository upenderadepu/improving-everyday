## Running Locally

### What you need first

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

- **Node.js v18 or higher**: Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) (LTS version is recommended)
  - To check if you already have it: open a terminal and run `node -v`
- **Git**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
  - To check if you already have it: run `git --version`

### Step-by-step setup

**1. Clone the repository**

This downloads the project code to your computer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/devops-lms.git
```

**2. Enter the project folder**

```bash
cd devops-lms
```

**3. Install dependencies**

This installs all the libraries the project needs. It may take a minute.

```bash
npm install
```

**4. Start the development server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

**5. Open the app**

Open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You'll be asked to create a learner profile on first launch. Enter any name and click **Get Started**.

> **Tip:** The development server supports hot reloading. Any changes you make to the code will appear in the browser instantly without restarting the server.

---

## Running with Docker

Docker lets you run the app in a container without installing Node.js. This is the recommended way to run it in production.

### What you need

- **Docker Desktop**: Download from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and ensure it is running

### Option 1: Pull the pre-built image from GitHub Container Registry

If the project has been pushed to GitHub, you can pull the ready-made image directly:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/<github-username>/<repo-name>:latest
docker run -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/<github-username>/<repo-name>:latest
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Option 2: Build the image yourself

If you've cloned the repository and want to build locally:

```bash
# Build the image (this takes a few minutes the first time)
docker build -t devops-lms .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 devops-lms
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To stop the container, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

### Run in the background (detached mode)

If you want the container to keep running after you close the terminal:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name devops-lms devops-lms
```

To stop it later:

```bash
docker stop devops-lms
```

---

## Building using Docker Compose (Self Hosting)
## Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Example compose file:

```yaml
services:
  improving-everyday:
    image: ghcr.io/sooraj-sky/improving-everyday:latest
    container_name: devops-local-book

    ports:
      - "3000:3000"

    environment:
      NODE_ENV: production
      PORT: 3000
      HOSTNAME: 0.0.0.0

    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Building for Production (without Docker)

If you want to run the optimised production build directly with Node.js:

```bash
# Build the app
npm run build

# Start the production server
npm start
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The production build is faster and uses less memory than the development server.

## Adding a New Track

Each learning track is a single TypeScript file. To add your own:

1. Create `lib/content/my-topic.ts` by copying the structure of an existing track, such as `lib/content/linux.ts`
2. Import and add it to the `tracks` array in `lib/content/index.ts`
3. Add a gradient colour class for the track card in `app/globals.css`

## Troubleshooting

**`npm install` fails**
Make sure you have Node.js v18 or higher. Run `node -v` to check. If the version is lower, download the latest LTS from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

**Port 3000 is already in use**
Another app is using port 3000. Either stop that app, or run the dev server on a different port:
```bash
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```
Then open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

**Docker build fails with "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon"**
Docker Desktop is not running. Open it from your Applications folder (Mac) or Start menu (Windows) and wait for it to fully start before running the build command again.

**Changes I make to the code don't appear**
Make sure the development server (`npm run dev`) is running. If it is, try refreshing the browser. If the issue persists, stop the server with `Ctrl + C` and start it again.
