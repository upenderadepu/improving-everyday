          content: `## What is DevSecOps?

DevSecOps extends DevOps by weaving security into *every* phase of the software delivery lifecycle — from the first commit to production monitoring — rather than bolting it on at the end.

> **"Shift left"** means catching vulnerabilities early (left on the timeline), when they cost 100× less to fix.

---

## The Cost of Late Security Fixes

| Phase discovered | Relative cost to fix |
|---|---|
| Design / code review | 1× |
| CI pipeline (SAST) | 5× |
| QA / staging | 10× |
| Production | 100× |
| Public breach | 1000× |

## The Shared Responsibility Model

In cloud environments security is split between the provider and the customer:

| Provider owns | Customer owns |
|---|---|
| Physical hardware | IAM & access control |
| Hypervisor | OS patching (EC2) |
| Managed service infrastructure | Application code |
| Network backbone | Data encryption in transit/at rest |
| Compliance certifications | Compliance configuration |

---

## OWASP Top 10 (2021)

1. Broken Access Control
2. Cryptographic Failures
3. Injection (SQL, NoSQL, LDAP, OS)
4. Insecure Design
5. Security Misconfiguration
6. Vulnerable & Outdated Components
7. Identification & Authentication Failures
8. Software & Data Integrity Failures (supply chain)
9. Security Logging & Monitoring Failures
10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

DevSecOps tools address every one of these through automation.

---

## Key Cultural Shifts

- **Security champions** — embed one security-minded engineer per team
- **Blameless post-mortems** — treat vulnerabilities as system failures, not individual mistakes
- **Security as code** — policy and compliance rules live in version-controlled files
- **Automated gates** — pipelines fail on critical findings; humans review, not approve everything

---

## Quick Wins to Start

\`\`\`bash
# 1. Enable branch protection on main
# (GitHub UI: Settings → Branches → Add rule)

# 2. Require signed commits
git config --global commit.gpgSign true

# 3. Add a .gitignore for secrets
echo ".env*" >> .gitignore
echo "*.pem"  >> .gitignore
echo "*.key"  >> .gitignore
\`\`\`

> **Tip:** The single highest-leverage first step is preventing secrets from ever entering version control. Everything else builds on that foundation.`,
          interviewQuestions: [
            {
              question: "What is DevSecOps and how does it differ from 'security as a separate team' model?",
              difficulty: "junior" as const,
              answer: `**Traditional security model:** Security team reviews code and infrastructure at the END of the SDLC (shift-right). Developers throw code over the wall, security says "that's insecure, fix it," then back to the developer queue. Result: security is a bottleneck, findings are late and expensive to fix.

**DevSecOps:** Security is integrated throughout the SDLC — shift-left means finding vulnerabilities earlier (when they're cheaper to fix) and making security automated (not manual):

\`\`\`
DevSecOps Pipeline:
[Code Commit] → [SAST scan] → [SCA/dependency check] → [IaC scan] →
[Container scan] → [DAST] → [Runtime monitoring]
       ↑                                                       ↑
   seconds after commit                           continuous in production
\`\`\`

**Key principles:**
1. **Everything as code**: Security policies, compliance checks, vulnerability thresholds are code, version-controlled, and tested
2. **Automated gates**: Security checks run automatically in CI/CD — developers get fast feedback without waiting for a security review cycle
3. **Shared responsibility**: Developers own security in their domain, not a separate team
4. **Metrics and SLOs**: Track MTTR for vulnerabilities like any other incident

**Practical shift:** Instead of "security team reviews before release," the pipeline runs automatically: Semgrep/CodeQL for SAST, Trivy for containers, Checkov for IaC, and only pages the security team for high-confidence critical findings. 95% of findings are handled without human review.`,
            },
            {
              question: "A developer accidentally commits an AWS access key to a public GitHub repository. What's your incident response?",
              difficulty: "mid" as const,
              answer: `**Assume compromised immediately** — GitHub indexes public repos within minutes, and bots scan for credentials continuously.

**Step 1 — Revoke the credential (< 2 minutes):**
\`\`\`bash
# Identify the key:
git log --all -p | grep -E "AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}"

# Revoke in AWS Console or CLI:
aws iam delete-access-key \\
  --access-key-id AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE \\
  --user-name <username>
# If you don't know which user: aws iam get-access-key-last-used --access-key-id AKIA...
\`\`\`

**Step 2 — Assess blast radius:**
\`\`\`bash
# What did this key have access to?
aws iam list-user-policies --user-name <user>
aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name <user>

# Was it used after the commit? Check CloudTrail:
aws cloudtrail lookup-events \\
  --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=AccessKeyId,AttributeValue=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE \\
  --start-time <commit-time>
\`\`\`

**Step 3 — Remove from git history:**
\`\`\`bash
# git filter-repo (preferred):
pip install git-filter-repo
git filter-repo --path-glob "*.env" --invert-paths

# After rewriting history, force push ALL branches:
git push origin --force --all
# Note: GitHub needs the branch to be unprotected
\`\`\`

**Step 4 — Notify and document:**
- Notify security team
- Create incident timeline
- If key had access to PII/sensitive data → assess breach notification requirements

**Prevention:**
\`\`\`bash
# Pre-commit hook using detect-secrets or gitleaks:
pip install detect-secrets
detect-secrets scan > .secrets.baseline  # committed to repo
# Add pre-commit hook to run detect-secrets scan on each commit

# GitHub secret scanning (enables automatic detection + revocation for some providers):
# Settings → Security → Code Security → Secret scanning

Threat modeling is a structured process for identifying security weaknesses in a system's design — before code is written.

## STRIDE Categories

| Category | What an attacker can do | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **S**poofing | Pretend to be someone else | Stolen JWT token |
| **T**ampering | Modify data in transit/rest | Man-in-the-middle, SQL injection |
| **R**epudiation | Deny performing an action | No audit logs → can't prove who did what |
| **I**nformation Disclosure | Read data they shouldn't | Verbose error messages exposing stack traces |
| **D**enial of Service | Make a service unavailable | Rate-limit bypass, resource exhaustion |
| **E**levation of Privilege | Gain more access than granted | IDOR, privilege escalation via sudo misconfiguration |

## Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

Draw the system at Level 0 (context) then Level 1 (components):

\`\`\`
[User Browser] ──HTTPS──> [Load Balancer] ──HTTP──> [App Server]
                                                          │

                                               [Object Store (S3)]
\`\`\`

For each arrow and component ask: *which STRIDE threats apply?*

---

## DREAD Risk Scoring

Score each threat 1–10 per dimension:

| Dimension | Question |
|---|---|
| **D**amage | How bad if exploited? |
| **R**eproducibility | How easily repeatable? |
| **E**xploitability | How much skill required? |
| **A**ffected users | How many impacted? |
| **D**iscoverability | How easy to find? |

\`\`\`
Risk Score = (D + R + E + A + D) / 5
High: 7-10 | Medium: 4-6 | Low: 1-3

          ],
          content: `## Git Security Best Practices

Git is the foundation of your supply chain. A misconfigured repository can expose secrets, allow unauthorized force-pushes, or permit unsigned code to reach production.

---

## Commit Signing with GPG

Signing proves a commit came from you, not an impersonator.

\`\`\`bash
# Generate a GPG key
gpg --full-generate-key
# Choose RSA 4096, no expiry (or 2y for better hygiene)

# List your keys
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long

# Export public key → paste into GitHub Settings → GPG Keys
gpg --armor --export YOUR_KEY_ID

# Tell git to use your key
git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_KEY_ID
git config --global commit.gpgSign true

# Verify a signed commit
git log --show-signature -1
\`\`\`

---

## Branch Protection Rules (GitHub)

Navigate to **Settings → Branches → Add rule** and enable:

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| Require pull request reviews (≥1) | Peer review catches issues |
| Require status checks to pass | CI must be green |
| Require signed commits | Prevent spoofed authorship |
| Restrict force pushes | Protect history |
| Require linear history | Easier audit trail |
| Require conversation resolution | No dismissed review comments |

\`\`\`bash
# Equivalent via GitHub CLI
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":1}' \
  --field enforce_admins=true \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["ci/tests"]}'
\`\`\`

---

## Detecting Secrets in History

Even after deleting a file, secrets persist in git history.

\`\`\`bash
# Install git-secrets (AWS patterns)
brew install git-secrets
git secrets --install
git secrets --register-aws

# Or use truffleHog to scan full history
pip install trufflehog
trufflehog git file://. --since-commit HEAD~50

# Or use gitleaks (fast Go binary)
brew install gitleaks
gitleaks detect --source . -v
\`\`\`

If a secret is found in history, you must:
1. Revoke the secret immediately (rotate credentials)
2. Rewrite history with \`git filter-repo\` (not filter-branch)
3. Force-push (coordinate with team — everyone must re-clone)

\`\`\`bash
# Remove a file from all history (after installing git-filter-repo)
git filter-repo --path secrets.env --invert-paths
git push origin --force --all
\`\`\`

---

## Pre-commit Hooks

Hooks run locally before a commit is created.

\`\`\`bash
# Install pre-commit framework
pip install pre-commit

# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks
    rev: v8.18.0
    hooks:
      - id: gitleaks

  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.5.0
    hooks:
      - id: detect-private-key
      - id: check-added-large-files  # prevents accidental binary commits
      - id: trailing-whitespace
\`\`\`

\`\`\`bash
pre-commit install     # installs hook into .git/hooks/pre-commit
pre-commit run --all-files  # run manually on existing code
\`\`\`

> **Tip:** Pre-commit hooks run client-side. They can be bypassed with \`git commit --no-verify\`. Always add server-side secret scanning (GitHub Advanced Security, GitLab Secret Detection) as the authoritative gate.`,

            "Apply semantic versioning to security releases",
          ],
          content: `## Branching Strategies for Security

Your branching model determines how quickly you can ship a security patch. A model optimised for slow, scheduled releases is dangerous in an incident.

---

## GitFlow

\`\`\`
main ──────────────────────────────────────── (always shippable)
  \\
   develop ──────────────────────────────────
     \\            \\
      feature/x    feature/y
              \\
               release/1.2 ── hotfix/1.2.1
\`\`\`

**Security pros:** Dedicated release branch allows security hardening before shipping.
**Security cons:** Long-lived branches diverge heavily — merge conflicts can mask vulnerability fixes.

---

## Trunk-Based Development (TBD)

\`\`\`
main ──●──●──●──●──●──●──●──●──  (deployable at every commit)
        \\              \\
         short-lived    short-lived
         feature (<2d)  feature (<2d)
\`\`\`

**Security pros:** No long-lived branches → no drift → security patches reach prod in hours.
**Security cons:** Requires robust feature flags to hide incomplete features.

---

## Security Patch / Hotfix Workflow

\`\`\`bash
# 1. Branch from the production tag
git checkout -b hotfix/CVE-2024-1234 v2.3.1

# 2. Apply minimal fix (no unrelated changes)
# Fix the vulnerability...
git commit -S -m "fix: patch SSRF in webhook handler (CVE-2024-1234)"

# 3. Open PR → expedited review (2 approvers minimum)
gh pr create --title "Security: CVE-2024-1234" --label "security,hotfix"

# 4. After merge, tag immediately
git tag -s v2.3.2 -m "Security release: CVE-2024-1234"
git push origin v2.3.2

# 5. Also merge fix forward to main / develop
git checkout main && git cherry-pick <sha>
\`\`\`

---

## Semantic Versioning for Security

\`\`\`
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
  │      │     └─ Backwards-compatible bug/security fix → bump PATCH
  │      └─────── New feature, backwards-compatible → bump MINOR
  └────────────── Breaking change → bump MAJOR
\`\`\`

Security-only releases always bump PATCH (or MINOR if the fix requires an API change).

Use **CHANGELOG.md** to communicate CVE details:

\`\`\`markdown
## [2.3.2] - 2024-03-15
### Security
- Fix SSRF vulnerability in webhook handler (CVE-2024-1234, CVSS 8.1)
  Users on 2.x should upgrade immediately.
\`\`\`

---

## Feature Flags for Safe Deployments

Decouple *deployment* (code in prod) from *release* (users can use it):

\`\`\`typescript
// Simple environment-variable flag
const NEW_AUTH_FLOW = process.env.ENABLE_NEW_AUTH === "true";

if (NEW_AUTH_FLOW) {
  return newAuthHandler(req, res);
} else {
  return legacyAuthHandler(req, res);
}
\`\`\`

Benefits for security:
- Ship unfinished security-sensitive features to prod but disabled
- Enable only for internal users first (canary)
- Kill-switch: disable without a deploy if a vulnerability is found

> **Tip:** Use a dedicated feature flag service (LaunchDarkly, Unleash, Flagsmith) rather than env vars for production — they support per-user targeting and instant kill-switches.`,

## GitHub Actions Secrets

\`\`\`yaml
# Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New secret

jobs:
  deploy:
    environment: production          # environment-level protection

      - name: Deploy
        env:
          DB_URL: \${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
          AWS_KEY: \${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        run: ./deploy.sh
\`\`\`

**Environment protection rules:**
- Require reviewers before secrets are exposed
- Limit to specific branches (e.g., only \`main\`)
- Add deployment wait timer

\`\`\`bash
# Add a secret via CLI
gh secret set DATABASE_URL --body "postgres://..." --env production
\`\`\`

---

## HashiCorp Vault

Vault is the industry standard for secrets management at scale.

\`\`\`bash
# Start dev server (local testing only)
vault server -dev

export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
export VAULT_TOKEN='root'

# Write a secret
vault kv put secret/myapp/db \
  username="app_user" \
  password="s3cr3t"

# Read it back
vault kv get secret/myapp/db
vault kv get -field=password secret/myapp/db

# Dynamic database credentials (auto-expire after TTL)
vault secrets enable database
vault write database/config/mydb \
  plugin_name=postgresql-database-plugin \
  connection_url="postgresql://{{username}}:{{password}}@localhost/mydb" \
  allowed_roles="app-role" \

  password="vault_admin_pass"

vault write database/roles/app-role \
  db_name=mydb \
  creation_statements="CREATE ROLE \"{{name}}\" WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '{{password}}' VALID UNTIL '{{expiration}}';" \
  default_ttl="1h" \
  max_ttl="24h"

# App reads fresh credentials each time
vault read database/creds/app-role
\`\`\`

---

## Fetching Vault Secrets in CI

\`\`\`yaml
# GitHub Actions with Vault OIDC (no static token)
- name: Import Secrets
  uses: hashicorp/vault-action@v3
  with:
    url: https://vault.example.com
    method: jwt

    secrets: |
      secret/data/myapp/db password | DB_PASSWORD ;
      secret/data/myapp/db username | DB_USERNAME
\`\`\`

---

## Rotation Strategy

| Secret type | Rotation frequency | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Database passwords | Every 30 days | Vault dynamic creds |
| API keys | Every 90 days | Automated via script |
| TLS certificates | Before expiry (Let's Encrypt auto) | cert-manager |
| SSH keys | Every 180 days | Key rotation policy |
| Root/admin credentials | Every 365 days | Manual + MFA |

\`\`\`bash
# Detect expiring AWS keys (rotate before they expire)
aws iam list-access-keys --user-name deploy-bot \
  | jq '.AccessKeyMetadata[] | {KeyId, CreateDate, Status}'

# Rotate
aws iam create-access-key --user-name deploy-bot
aws iam delete-access-key --user-name deploy-bot --access-key-id OLD_KEY_ID

## SAST with Semgrep

Semgrep uses pattern-matching rules to find security bugs fast.

\`\`\`bash
# Install
pip install semgrep

# Run with OWASP Top 10 rules
semgrep --config=p/owasp-top-ten .

# Run with security-audit ruleset
semgrep --config=p/security-audit .

# JSON output for CI
semgrep --config=p/owasp-top-ten --json > semgrep-results.json
\`\`\`

**GitHub Actions integration:**

\`\`\`yaml
name: SAST
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  semgrep:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

\`\`\`bash
# npm — accept a known non-exploitable advisory
npm audit --audit-level=high  # review the advisory ID
npm audit fix --force         # only if you understand the change

          interviewQuestions: [
            {
              question: "Explain the difference between SAST, DAST, and SCA. When does each run in a CI/CD pipeline?",
              difficulty: "junior" as const,
              answer: `**SAST (Static Application Security Testing):**
- Analyzes source code without running it
- Finds: SQL injection patterns, XSS, hardcoded secrets, insecure crypto
- Runs at: PR time, pre-merge (fast, seconds to minutes)
- Tools: Semgrep, CodeQL, SonarQube, Checkmarx

**SCA (Software Composition Analysis):**
- Scans third-party dependencies/libraries for known CVEs
- Finds: vulnerable package versions (e.g., Log4j CVE-2021-44228)
- Runs at: PR time, daily scheduled scans (CVEs are discovered continuously)
- Tools: Dependabot, Snyk, npm audit, Trivy (for containers)

**DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing):**
- Tests the running application by sending malicious inputs
- Finds: runtime vulnerabilities, auth bypasses, actual exploitable paths
- Runs at: staging environment, post-deploy (needs a running app)
- Tools: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Nuclei

**Pipeline placement:**
\`\`\`
[Commit] → SAST + SCA ← (fast gates, block on critical)
[PR Merge] → Build image → Container scan (Trivy)
[Deploy to Staging] → DAST scan (ZAP)
[Production] → Runtime protection (WAF, RASP)
\`\`\`

**Why the order matters:** SAST at commit is cheapest (catches issues before the code even runs). DAST at staging is most accurate but slowest (requires a deployed environment). Running DAST against production is possible but risky — use a separate production-like environment.`,
            },
            {
              question: "You've integrated SAST into CI/CD and it reports 300 findings. How do you triage and prioritize without blocking all development?",
              difficulty: "mid" as const,
              answer: `**Immediate triage strategy:**

**1. Start permissive, tighten over time:**
\`\`\`yaml
# Week 1: Only block on CRITICAL, report others
- name: Semgrep
  run: semgrep --config auto --severity=ERROR --error
  # ERROR = CRITICAL findings → fail build
  # WARN/INFO → report but don't fail
\`\`\`

**2. Establish a baseline:**
\`\`\`bash
# Scan current codebase, mark ALL current findings as accepted (technical debt)
semgrep --config auto --json > baseline.json
# Commit baseline.json — only NEW findings since baseline fail the build
# This prevents existing tech debt from blocking new work
\`\`\`

**3. Triage the 300 findings:**
- **True positives critical**: Fix immediately, block
- **True positives non-critical**: Add to sprint backlog, track as tech debt
- **False positives**: Suppress with inline comments or rule exceptions:
\`\`\`python
# nosec: B105 — this is not a password, it's a config key name
CONFIG_KEY = "password_field"  # noqa: S105
\`\`\`

**4. Prioritize by:**
- Severity (CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW)
- Reachability (is the vulnerable code actually called in a user-facing path?)
- CVSS score + exploitability (is there a working exploit in the wild?)

**5. Track metrics:**
- New vulnerabilities introduced per week (should trend toward 0)
- MTTR (mean time to remediate) by severity
- False positive rate (high FP rate = tune rules or switch tools)

**Anti-pattern:** Blocking ALL 300 on day 1 → developers disable the tool or bypass it.`,

## DAST with OWASP ZAP

\`\`\`bash
# Quick baseline scan (passive — no active attacks)
docker run -t owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-baseline.py \
  -t https://staging.myapp.com \
  -r zap-report.html

# Full active scan (attacks the app — only against staging/test!)

## Container Scanning with Trivy

Trivy scans OS packages, language dependencies, and misconfigurations.

\`\`\`bash
# Install
brew install trivy

# Scan a local image
trivy image myapp:latest

# Scan with severity filter
trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL myapp:latest

# Exit code 1 on critical (for CI gate)
trivy image --exit-code 1 --severity CRITICAL myapp:latest

trivy config Dockerfile

# Scan filesystem (before building image)
trivy fs .

## Distroless Base Images

Distroless images contain only your app and its runtime — no shell, no package manager.

\`\`\`dockerfile
# Before: full Debian — 900MB, hundreds of packages
FROM node:20

# After: distroless — ~180MB, minimal attack surface
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app

## Image Signing with Cosign

Signing proves an image wasn't tampered with between build and deployment.

\`\`\`bash
# Install cosign
brew install cosign

# Generate a key pair (or use keyless with OIDC)
cosign generate-key-pair

# Sign after push
docker push myregistry/myapp:v1.0.0
cosign sign --key cosign.key myregistry/myapp:v1.0.0

# Verify before deployment
cosign verify --key cosign.pub myregistry/myapp:v1.0.0

# Keyless signing (no key management — uses OIDC identity)
cosign sign myregistry/myapp:v1.0.0
# Prompts for OIDC login; signature stored in Rekor transparency log
\`\`\`

> **Tip:** Pair Cosign with a Kubernetes admission controller (Kyverno or OPA/Gatekeeper) that rejects unsigned images. This prevents pulling an attacker-modified image even if they compromised your registry.`,

SAST and image scanning catch vulnerabilities before deployment. Falco catches attacks *during* execution — detecting container escapes, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration in real time.

---

## How Falco Works

Falco uses Linux kernel syscall tracing (via eBPF or kernel module) to observe every process, file access, and network connection inside containers.

\`\`\`
Container process → syscall → Kernel (eBPF hook) → Falco engine → Rule match → Alert
\`\`\`

---

## Installing Falco on Kubernetes

\`\`\`bash
helm repo add falcosecurity https://falcosecurity.github.io/charts
helm repo update

helm install falco falcosecurity/falco \
  --namespace falco \
  --create-namespace \
  --set driver.kind=ebpf \
  --set falcosidekick.enabled=true \
  --set falcosidekick.config.slack.webhookurl="https://hooks.slack.com/..."

# Verify
kubectl get pods -n falco
kubectl logs -n falco -l app.kubernetes.io/name=falco
\`\`\`

---

## Built-in Rules (Examples)

\`\`\`yaml
# Falco triggers on these by default:

# Shell spawned in a container
- rule: Terminal shell in container
  desc: A shell was used as the entrypoint or is spawned in a container
  condition: >
    spawned_process and container
    and shell_procs and proc.tty != 0
  output: >
    A shell was spawned in a container (user=%user.name container=%container.name
    image=%container.image.repository shell=%proc.name)
  priority: WARNING

# Sensitive file read
- rule: Read sensitive file trusted after startup
  condition: >
    open_read and sensitive_files
    and not proc.name in (trusted_file_readers)

## Incident Response Playbook

When Falco fires **"Shell spawned in container"**:

\`\`\`bash
# 1. Identify the container
kubectl get pods -A | grep <container-name>

# 2. Capture forensic evidence BEFORE killing
kubectl exec -n <ns> <pod> -- ps aux > /tmp/forensics-ps.txt
kubectl exec -n <ns> <pod> -- netstat -tlnp > /tmp/forensics-net.txt
kubectl logs -n <ns> <pod> --since=1h > /tmp/forensics-logs.txt

# 3. Isolate the pod (network policy)
kubectl label pod <pod> -n <ns> security.kubernetes.io/quarantine=true

# 4. Apply deny-all network policy to quarantine label
# 5. Cordon the node if node compromise suspected
kubectl cordon <node-name>

# 6. Preserve the pod spec for investigation
kubectl get pod <pod> -n <ns> -o yaml > /tmp/forensics-podspec.yaml

# 7. Delete the compromised pod (replacement spawns from deployment)
kubectl delete pod <pod> -n <ns>
\`\`\`

> **Tip:** Use Falco's \`json_output: true\` and forward to your SIEM (Elastic, Splunk) for correlation. A single Falco alert rarely means compromise; patterns across multiple pods in minutes are high-confidence indicators.`,

Gatekeeper enforces policies at Kubernetes admission time — pods violating policy are rejected before they start.

\`\`\`bash
# Install Gatekeeper
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/release-3.14/deploy/gatekeeper.yaml
\`\`\`

\`\`\`yaml
# Constraint Template: require security context
apiVersion: templates.gatekeeper.sh/v1
kind: ConstraintTemplate
metadata:
  name: requiresecuritycontext
spec:
  crd:
    spec:
      names:
        kind: RequireSecurityContext
  targets:
    - target: admission.k8s.gatekeeper.sh
      rego: |
        package requiresecuritycontext
        violation[{"msg": msg}] {
          container := input.review.object.spec.containers[_]
          not container.securityContext.runAsNonRoot
          msg := sprintf("Container '%v' must run as non-root", [container.name])
        }

## Generating Audit Evidence Automatically

\`\`\`yaml
# GitHub Actions — create audit artifact on every release
jobs:
  audit-evidence:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Collect Evidence
        run: |
          echo "=== Git Log (signed commits) ===" > evidence.txt
          git log --show-signature --oneline -20 >> evidence.txt

          echo "=== PR Reviews ===" >> evidence.txt
          gh pr list --state merged --limit 20 \
            --json number,title,reviewDecision,mergedAt \
            >> evidence.txt

          echo "=== Dependency Audit ===" >> evidence.txt
          npm audit --json >> evidence.txt
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: \${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Upload Evidence
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4

## Security Scorecard

Use OpenSSF Scorecard to get an automated security score for your repo:

\`\`\`bash
docker run -e GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=\$GH_TOKEN \
  gcr.io/openssf/scorecard:stable \
  --repo=github.com/myorg/myapp \
  --format json \
  | jq '.checks[] | {name, score, reason}'
\`\`\`

Checks include: Branch-Protection, Code-Review, Signed-Releases, Vulnerabilities, Token-Permissions, Secret detection.

> **Tip:** Automate scorecard in CI and alert when the score drops below your threshold (e.g., 7/10). Publish the badge in README.md to signal security posture to external contributors and auditors.`,
