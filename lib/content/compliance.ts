The **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** was enacted in 1996. It applies to **covered entities** (hospitals, insurers, providers) and their **business associates** (cloud vendors, SaaS platforms, billing services) who handle **Protected Health Information (PHI)**.

### Three Core Rules

| Rule | What It Governs |
|------|----------------|
| **Privacy Rule** | Use and disclosure of PHI |
| **Security Rule** | Technical/physical/administrative safeguards for ePHI |
| **Breach Notification Rule** | Reporting requirements after a breach |

### What Is PHI?

PHI is any individually identifiable health information. The 18 HIPAA identifiers include:

- Name, address, phone, email
- Dates (birth, admission, discharge, death)
- Social Security Number, account numbers
- Device identifiers, IP addresses
- Biometric identifiers, photos

**De-identified data is not PHI** — HIPAA provides two de-identification methods: Safe Harbor (remove all 18 identifiers) and Expert Determination (statistical analysis proving re-identification risk < 0.01%).

### Safeguard Categories

**Administrative safeguards** (§164.308):
- Security Officer designation
- Workforce training and access management
- Risk analysis and risk management
- Contingency planning

**Physical safeguards** (§164.310):
- Facility access controls
- Workstation security
- Device and media controls (including disposal)

**Technical safeguards** (§164.312):
- Access controls (unique user IDs, emergency access)
- Audit controls (hardware and software activity logs)
- Integrity controls (ePHI must not be improperly altered)
- Transmission security (encryption in transit)

### Business Associate Agreements

Any vendor that touches PHI must sign a BAA. AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure all offer BAAs for covered services. Key BAA clauses:

\`\`\`
- Permitted uses of PHI
- Obligation to report breaches within 60 days of discovery
- Return or destroy PHI upon contract termination
- Ensure downstream subcontractors also sign BAAs
\`\`\`

### Breach Notification

- **Covered entity** must notify affected individuals within **60 days** of discovery
- Breaches affecting **500+ individuals** must notify HHS and media simultaneously
- HHS maintains a public "Wall of Shame" for large breaches
- **Business associate** must notify covered entity within **60 days** of discovery

### HIPAA Enforcement

- Office for Civil Rights (OCR) enforces HIPAA
- Penalties range from **\$100 to \$50,000 per violation** (up to \$1.9M annually per violation category)
- Criminal penalties possible for willful neglect

> **Key insight for engineers:** HIPAA doesn't mandate specific technologies — it requires reasonable and appropriate safeguards based on your organization's risk analysis. Document everything.`,

Better approach: store only non-PHI tokens in the cache and look up PHI from the secured backend when needed.

          content: `## Technical Safeguards in Practice

HIPAA's technical safeguards (45 CFR §164.312) require four categories of controls for electronic PHI (ePHI).

### 1. Access Controls (§164.312(a))

Each user must have a **unique identifier** — shared accounts are a HIPAA violation. Implement least-privilege IAM:

\`\`\`json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "s3:GetObject"
    ],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::phi-bucket/patients/\${!aws:username}/*",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {"aws:RequestedRegion": "us-east-1"},
      "Bool": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "true"}
    }
  }]
}
\`\`\`

**Emergency access procedure**: Maintain a documented "break-glass" account for emergency access, with automatic alerts and post-incident review.

### 2. Audit Controls (§164.312(b))

Track all access to ePHI at the application layer:

\`\`\`python
import logging
import json
from datetime import datetime

def log_phi_access(user_id: str, patient_id: str, action: str, record_type: str):
    audit_event = {
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
        "user_id": user_id,
        "patient_id": patient_id,
        "action": action,          # READ, WRITE, DELETE, EXPORT
        "record_type": record_type, # demographics, labs, notes
        "ip_address": get_client_ip(),
        "session_id": get_session_id(),
    }
    # Write to append-only audit log (CloudWatch Logs, immutable S3)
    logging.getLogger("phi_audit").info(json.dumps(audit_event))
\`\`\`

### 3. Integrity Controls (§164.312(c))

ePHI must not be improperly altered or destroyed. Implement:

- **S3 Object Lock** (WORM) for audit logs
- **Database row versioning** — never DELETE PHI, use soft deletes with timestamps
- **Checksums** — verify file integrity after transmission

\`\`\`sql
-- Soft delete pattern for HIPAA
ALTER TABLE patient_records ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE patient_records ADD COLUMN deletion_reason TEXT;

-- Never: DELETE FROM patient_records WHERE id = 123;
-- Always:
UPDATE patient_records
SET deleted_at = NOW(), deletion_reason = 'Patient request - §45 CFR 164.526'
WHERE id = 123;
\`\`\`

### 4. Transmission Security (§164.312(e))

- Enforce **TLS 1.2 minimum** (TLS 1.3 preferred)
- Never send PHI over unencrypted HTTP
- Use **AWS PrivateLink** or VPC endpoints for service-to-service ePHI transfers
- Disable email transmission of PHI unless using encrypted email (S/MIME, PGP)

### Encryption at Rest

Use **AWS KMS Customer Managed Keys (CMK)** for PHI:

\`\`\`bash
# Create a HIPAA-dedicated KMS key with rotation
aws kms create-key \\
  --description "PHI encryption key - HIPAA" \\
  --key-usage ENCRYPT_DECRYPT \\
  --key-spec SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT

aws kms enable-key-rotation --key-id <key-id>

# Apply to RDS
aws rds create-db-instance \\
  --storage-encrypted \\
  --kms-key-id <key-id> \\
  --db-instance-identifier phi-database \\
  ...
\`\`\`

### Minimum Necessary Standard

Only access, use, or disclose the minimum PHI necessary. In code:

\`\`\`python
# BAD: Returning full patient record
def get_appointment_status(patient_id):
    return db.query("SELECT * FROM patients WHERE id = ?", patient_id)

# GOOD: Return only fields needed for the specific use case
def get_appointment_status(patient_id):
    return db.query(
        "SELECT appointment_date, status, provider_name FROM patients WHERE id = ?",
        patient_id
    )
\`\`\`

### AWS HIPAA-Eligible Services

Not all AWS services are HIPAA-eligible. Covered services include: EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, DynamoDB, EKS, Secrets Manager, and more. Always verify at the AWS HIPAA page before storing PHI in a new service.`,

Shared credentials make audit trails meaningless: you cannot prove who accessed a specific patient record.

The accessing user must document the emergency reason in a ticket within 1 hour. A post-incident review happens within 24 hours.

If you cannot rule out unauthorized access, it IS a reportable breach. Notify the Privacy Officer immediately. If reportable: follow Breach Notification Rule (60-day clock starts from discovery).

Application-level encryption (end-to-end) encrypts at the application layer so PHI is encrypted before it leaves the client and only decrypted by the intended recipient — even the server/vendor cannot read it. For HIPAA: TLS is required as a minimum. Application-level encryption is required when PHI passes through third-party systems where you cannot trust or audit the intermediary (e.g., patient messaging through a third-party chat platform). Most HIPAA-covered web APIs satisfy the requirement with TLS 1.2+, but messaging apps and file sharing require stronger guarantees.",

GDPR is EU law (effective May 25, 2018) that protects EU/EEA residents' personal data. It applies to any organization that processes data of EU residents — regardless of where the organization is located. Violations: up to **€20 million or 4% of global annual turnover** (whichever is higher).

### The Seven Principles (Article 5)

1. **Lawfulness, fairness, transparency** — Tell people what you're doing, do it legally
2. **Purpose limitation** — Collect data for specified, explicit purposes only
3. **Data minimization** — Collect only what you need
4. **Accuracy** — Keep data correct and up-to-date
5. **Storage limitation** — Don't keep data longer than needed
6. **Integrity and confidentiality** — Secure the data (encryption, access controls)
7. **Accountability** — You must be able to demonstrate compliance

### Six Lawful Bases for Processing

| Basis | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| **Consent** | Freely given, specific, informed, unambiguous opt-in |
| **Contract** | Necessary to perform a contract with the individual |
| **Legal obligation** | Required by law |
| **Vital interests** | Life or death emergency |
| **Public task** | Exercise of official authority |
| **Legitimate interests** | Balanced against individual's rights (requires LIA) |

### Data Subject Rights

| Right | Timeframe |
|-------|-----------|
| **Access (SAR)** | 1 month |
| **Rectification** | 1 month |
| **Erasure ("right to be forgotten")** | 1 month |
| **Restriction of processing** | 1 month |
| **Data portability** | 1 month |
| **Object to processing** | Must stop immediately |
| **Rights re automated decisions** | Must provide human review |

### Key Roles

**Data Controller**: Decides why and how data is processed. Ultimately responsible.
**Data Processor**: Processes data on behalf of the controller (e.g., your SaaS vendor).
**Data Protection Officer (DPO)**: Required for public authorities, large-scale systematic monitoring, or large-scale special category data processing. The DPO must be independent and report to top management.

### Special Categories of Data

Extra protection required for: health data, biometric data, genetic data, racial/ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, sex life/sexual orientation.

### Breach Notification (Article 33-34)

- **72 hours** to notify the supervisory authority (e.g., ICO in UK, CNIL in France)
- Notify affected individuals "without undue delay" if high risk to their rights
- Breaches not likely to result in risk don't require individual notification
- Maintain a breach register even for non-reportable incidents

### International Transfers

Transferring data outside EU/EEA requires: adequacy decision (UK, Canada, Japan, etc.), Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), or Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs). The EU-US Data Privacy Framework (2023) replaced Privacy Shield.`,

The data processor processes data on behalf of the controller according to their instructions. A processor can only process data as instructed by the controller and must sign a Data Processing Agreement (DPA). Both have GDPR obligations, but controllers have more responsibility.

              answer: "Use consent when you want to do something that isn't strictly necessary for your service and where you want individuals to have genuine choice — e.g., marketing emails, non-essential cookies, sharing data with third parties. Consent must be freely given (no bundling with service terms), specific, informed, and unambiguous (no pre-ticked boxes). Use legitimate interests when processing is necessary for a genuine purpose, that purpose isn't overridden by the individual's rights. Requires a Legitimate Interests Assessment (LIA). Example: fraud prevention, network security, direct marketing to existing customers (with opt-out). Never use legitimate interests for processing children's data or special categories.",

              answer: "If the SaaS vendor participates in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), that provides the adequacy basis. If not, use Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) — the 2021 EU SCCs must be incorporated into the contract with the processor. The SCCs cover controller-to-controller and controller-to-processor transfers. You must also conduct a Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA) to assess whether the destination country's laws undermine the SCCs' protections. Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) are another option but take years to approve and are for intra-group transfers.",

Notify individuals 'without undue delay' if high risk. No 72h clock for individual notification — must be 'without undue delay.' HIPAA: notify affected individuals within **60 days** of discovery. No 72-hour supervisory authority timeline. Key differences: GDPR's 72h to regulator is much faster; HIPAA gives 60 days to individuals. GDPR notification applies to all personal data breaches (not just health); HIPAA is health-data specific. GDPR requires risk assessment to determine if notification is needed; HIPAA uses a different 'low probability of compromise' safe harbor standard.",

Backups: Aligned with account data - ensure erasure requests propagate to backups within 30 days (backup cycle should not exceed this)
Analytics (aggregated): Indefinite (anonymized data is not personal data)

Implementation:
- Automated deletion jobs running nightly for expired data

Privacy by design means building privacy protections into systems from the start — not bolting them on later. Seven foundational principles (Ann Cavoukian):

1. **Proactive not reactive** — Anticipate privacy issues before they happen
2. **Privacy as the default** — Default settings should be most privacy-protective
3. **Privacy embedded into design** — Not an add-on
4. **Full functionality** — Privacy and business goals aren't zero-sum
5. **End-to-end security** — Protect data throughout its lifecycle
6. **Visibility and transparency** — Open about practices
7. **Respect for user privacy** — Keep it user-centric

### Practical Privacy by Design

\`\`\`
// BAD: Collect everything, figure out what you need later
user.save({
  name, email, phone, dob, address, ip, device_id,
  browsing_history, location, ...everything
})

// GOOD: Collect only what serves a specific, documented purpose
user.save({
  email,              // login - legal basis: contract
  name,               // display - legal basis: contract
  // phone: OPTIONAL, only if 2FA enabled
  // location: NOT collected, not needed for service
})
\`\`\`

### Records of Processing Activities (RoPA)

Article 30 requires organizations with 250+ employees (or processing special categories) to maintain a RoPA. For each processing activity document:

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Activity name | User registration |
| Controller/processor | Acme Corp (controller) |
| Purposes | Account creation, service delivery |
| Data categories | Email, name, preferences |
| Data subjects | End users / customers |
| Recipients | None / AWS (processor) |
| International transfers | None |
| Retention period | 3 years after account closure |
| Security measures | Encrypted at rest (AES-256), TLS in transit |

### Pseudonymization vs Anonymization

**Pseudonymized data** = still personal data (can be re-identified with the key). Requires GDPR protections but earns certain benefits (e.g., data breach lower risk threshold, easier to use for research).

**Anonymized data** = not personal data (irreversibly stripped of identifying info). GDPR doesn't apply.

\`\`\`python
import hashlib
import secrets

# Pseudonymization: replace direct identifier with token
# Store mapping separately (in secure vault, not with data)
def pseudonymize(user_id: str, secret_key: str) -> str:
    return hashlib.hmac(
        secret_key.encode(), user_id.encode(), 'sha256'
    ).hexdigest()

# Anonymization: k-anonymity example
# Generalize quasi-identifiers so each record is
# indistinguishable from at least k-1 others
# Age 34 -> Age range 30-39
# ZIP 90210 -> ZIP region 902
\`\`\`

SOC 2 is a voluntary audit framework by AICPA that evaluates a service organization's controls around **security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy**. B2B SaaS companies commonly undergo SOC 2 audits to give enterprise customers assurance.

### Five Trust Service Criteria (TSC)

| Criterion | What Auditors Examine |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Security (CC)** | Access controls, encryption, incident response, change management, risk assessment — required for all SOC 2 reports |
| **Availability (A)** | Uptime commitments, disaster recovery, performance monitoring |
| **Processing Integrity (PI)** | Complete, valid, accurate, timely processing — important for financial/payment systems |
| **Confidentiality (C)** | Data classified as confidential is protected through lifecycle |
| **Privacy (P)** | AICPA's GAPP principles aligned with GDPR/CCPA |

### Type I vs Type II

| | Type I | Type II |
|-|--------|---------|
| **What** | Controls described and designed appropriately | Controls are operating effectively |
| **Period** | Point in time | 6-12 month observation period |
| **Value** | Faster to obtain; shows intent | Higher assurance; shows controls actually work |
| **Timeline** | 2-4 months | 6-18 months |

Most enterprise customers require Type II. Start with Type I to get certified faster, then pursue Type II.

### Common SOC 2 CC Controls

\`\`\`
CC6.1 - Logical and physical access controls
CC6.2 - User provisioning/deprovisioning
CC6.3 - Role-based access control
CC7.1 - Vulnerability management
CC7.2 - Monitoring for anomalies
CC8.1 - Change management process
CC9.1 - Risk assessment process
\`\`\`

### Building Evidence

Auditors request evidence for each control. Automate evidence collection:

\`\`\`bash
# Evidence for CC6.1: List all IAM users and their MFA status
aws iam generate-credential-report
aws iam get-credential-report --query 'Content' --output text | \\
  base64 -d | grep -v mfa_active=false

# Evidence for CC7.1: Vulnerability scan results
aws ecr describe-image-scan-findings \\
  --repository-name my-app \\
  --image-id imageTag=latest

# Evidence for CC8.1: Change management - git log as evidence
git log --oneline --since="90 days ago" > change_log_evidence.txt
\`\`\`

## PCI-DSS: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard

PCI-DSS applies to any organization that stores, processes, or transmits cardholder data (credit/debit card numbers, CVV, PINs). Version 4.0 is current (released 2022).

### 12 PCI-DSS Requirements

1. Install and maintain network security controls
2. Apply secure configurations to all system components
3. Protect stored account data
4. Protect cardholder data with strong cryptography in transit
5. Protect all systems from malware
6. Develop and maintain secure systems and software
7. Restrict access to system components by business need-to-know
8. Identify users and authenticate access
9. Restrict physical access to cardholder data
10. Log and monitor all access to system components and cardholder data
11. Test security of systems and networks regularly
12. Support information security with organizational policies

### PCI Scope Reduction

The best PCI strategy is **scope reduction** — minimize where cardholder data flows:

\`\`\`
Without scope reduction:
Web server → App server → DB (all in PCI scope)

With tokenization:
User → Payment iframe (Stripe/Braintree hosted) → Token returned
Your app stores TOKEN only (not card number)
→ Only the payment vendor handles actual card data
→ Your scope is dramatically reduced (SAQ A or SAQ A-EP)
\`\`\`

## ISO 27001

International standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). 114 controls across 14 domains. Certification requires external audit against the standard. More process/policy focused than SOC 2's control testing. Common in Europe and enterprise procurement requirements.`,

Treating compliance controls as code means they are:
- **Version controlled** — auditors can see the history
- **Testable** — you can write unit tests for policies
- **Automated** — enforced before deployment, not after
- **Auditable** — evidence is generated automatically

### Open Policy Agent (OPA)

OPA is a general-purpose policy engine. Write policies in Rego:

\`\`\`rego
# policy/no_root_containers.rego
package kubernetes.admission

deny[msg] {
  input.request.kind.kind == "Pod"
  container := input.request.object.spec.containers[_]
  container.securityContext.runAsRoot == true
  msg := sprintf("Container '%v' must not run as root", [container.name])
}

deny[msg] {
  input.request.kind.kind == "Pod"
  container := input.request.object.spec.containers[_]
  not container.securityContext.readOnlyRootFilesystem
  msg := sprintf("Container '%v' must have read-only root filesystem", [container.name])
}
\`\`\`

Test your policies:
\`\`\`bash
# opa test policy/ -v
PASS: 5/5
\`\`\`

### Terraform Sentinel (HashiCorp)

Policy as code for Terraform plans — runs in CI/CD before \`terraform apply\`:

\`\`\`hcl
# sentinel/restrict-s3-public.sentinel
import "tfplan/v2" as tfplan

# All S3 buckets must block public access
main = rule {
  all tfplan.resource_changes as _, changes {
    changes.type is "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" implies {
      changes.change.after.block_public_acls is true
      changes.change.after.block_public_policy is true
      changes.change.after.restrict_public_buckets is true
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

### AWS Config Continuous Compliance

\`\`\`bash
# Deploy multiple compliance rules
aws configservice put-config-rule --config-rule '{
  "ConfigRuleName": "s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited",
  "Source": {"Owner": "AWS", "SourceIdentifier": "S3_BUCKET_PUBLIC_READ_PROHIBITED"}

  "Source": {"Owner": "AWS", "SourceIdentifier": "IAM_USER_MFA_ENABLED"}
}'

# Check compliance status
aws configservice describe-compliance-by-config-rule
\`\`\`

### Prowler Security Assessment

\`\`\`bash
# Install and run Prowler
pip install prowler

# Run all HIPAA checks
prowler aws --compliance hipaa_aws \\
  --output-formats json html \\
  --output-directory ./prowler-reports

# Run SOC 2 checks
prowler aws --compliance soc2_aws

# Run for specific account
prowler aws --profile production \\
  --compliance pci_dss_v4_aws \\

\`\`\`

### Chef InSpec for Infrastructure Compliance

\`\`\`ruby
# inspec/controls/s3_security.rb
control 'S3-01' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'S3 buckets must not be public'
  desc 'All S3 buckets must block public access per HIPAA/SOC2'

  aws_s3_buckets.bucket_names.each do |bucket|
    describe aws_s3_bucket(bucket_name: bucket) do
      it { should_not be_public }
      its('bucket_acl') { should_not include('AllUsers') }

### Compliance Dashboard with Security Hub

AWS Security Hub aggregates findings from Config, GuardDuty, Inspector, Macie, and third-party tools into a single compliance dashboard with frameworks mapped:

\`\`\`bash
# Enable Security Hub with standard frameworks
aws securityhub enable-security-hub \\
  --enable-default-standards

# Enable specific standards
aws securityhub batch-enable-standards \\
  --standards-subscription-requests '[

Terraform Sentinel is HashiCorp's policy-as-code framework that runs during the Terraform plan phase — it can prevent 'terraform apply' from running if policies are violated.

            { question: "How do you implement drift detection for compliance — detecting when a resource was manually changed outside of Terraform?", answer: "Use AWS Config: it detects when a resource configuration differs from its expected state. CloudTrail events trigger Config re-evaluation. For Terraform state drift: run 'terraform plan' periodically (scheduled CI job) — any diff indicates drift. Terraform Cloud has native drift detection. For a full solution: AWS Config rules define the policy, Config remediation actions (via Systems Manager Automation) auto-remediate violations, and SNS alerts notify the team.

Deploy common Config rules via AWS Organization-level SCPs and CloudFormation StackSets — this ensures the same rules apply everywhere. Use Security Hub with cross-account aggregation in a security tooling account. Set up EventBridge rules in each account to forward compliance violations to a central SNS/SQS for alerting. Run Prowler from a centralized CI pipeline across all accounts using assumed roles. Generate weekly compliance reports from Security Hub's API. Use AWS Config conformance packs for pre-built compliance frameworks (HIPAA, PCI, NIST).", difficulty: "senior" },
            { question: "What is a Config conformance pack and how does it differ from individual Config rules?", answer: "A conformance pack is a collection of AWS Config rules and remediation actions packaged together to address a compliance framework. AWS provides pre-built packs for PCI-DSS, HIPAA, NIST 800-53, CIS Benchmarks, SOC 2. A conformance pack deploys all rules atomically and generates a consolidated compliance score for the entire pack. Individual Config rules are single checks. Conformance packs give you a framework-level view ('75% compliant with HIPAA') vs. individual rule pass/fail.

            { question: "What is the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and how does it relate to SOC 2?", answer: "NIST CSF is a voluntary framework with five functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover. It's a risk management framework. SOC 2 maps well to NIST CSF — SOC 2 controls address Protect (access controls, encryption), Detect (monitoring, logging), and Respond (incident response). Many organizations use NIST CSF as their internal framework and SOC 2 as the external audit to validate it.", difficulty: "senior" },
            { question: "How do you handle false positives in automated compliance scanning?", answer: "False positives waste engineer time and erode trust in the tool. Handling: 1) Document suppressions with justification and owner (code-level comments or config files). 2) Use tool-specific suppression mechanisms (Prowler's ignore files, Trivy's .trivyignore, Checkov's skip_checks). 3) Require manager/security team approval for suppressions. 4) Set expiry dates on suppressions — review quarterly. 5) Track all suppressions in a register. 6) Distinguish 'risk accepted' (legitimate suppression) from 'under remediation' (tracking open issues). Auditors will ask about suppressed findings.", difficulty: "senior" },
            { question: "What is SBOM and why is it important for compliance?", answer: "Software Bill of Materials — a formal inventory of all components in a software artifact (libraries, versions, licenses, vulnerabilities). Required by US Executive Order 14028 for software sold to federal government. Important for compliance: identifies known vulnerabilities in dependencies (CVE tracking), tracks license compliance (GPL restrictions in commercial software), enables faster incident response when a new CVE drops. Generate with Syft, CycloneDX, or SPDX. Store SBOM in artifact registry alongside images.", difficulty: "senior" },

            { question: "What is the difference between a security audit and a penetration test, and when do compliance frameworks require each?", answer: "Security audit: systematic review of controls, policies, and configurations against a standard — can be done by internal or external team, produces a compliance report. Penetration test: simulated attack by skilled testers to find exploitable vulnerabilities — must be authorized, scoped, and documented. PCI-DSS requires both annual pen tests (internal + external) and quarterly vulnerability scans. SOC 2 requires evidence of security testing (pen test evidence is commonly used). HIPAA requires risk analysis (which may include pen testing). ISO 27001 requires systematic vulnerability assessments. Pen test results + remediation evidence are key audit artifacts.", difficulty: "senior" },
